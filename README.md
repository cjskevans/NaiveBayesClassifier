	This program was written by Charlie Evans and Luke Tangen for an assignment in Natural Language Processing CS [45] 242.
	This program (Naive Bayes Classifier) is one of 2 that will be submitted along with our Naive Bayes Eval. The purpose
	of the project is to go through a text file filled with movie reviews and assign them either positive or negative.
	Our eval will produce the accuracy, precision, recall, number of true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative
	all on separate lines for the user. Our goal was that our accuracy was above 60%
